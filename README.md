# Minesweeper
Command line version of the game "Minesweeper" in C.

The Makefile uses gcc but any c compiler will do.

To run, cd into the directory (cloned or unzipped) and enter

`make all`

For a version that doesn't use ascii characters, enter

`make ascii`

instead. 

Feel free to customize the Makefile before you call make.
